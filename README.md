# Python Tutorial

This tutorial is firstly designed for the study group called '**fMRI with Deep Learning**'. This tutorial is not going to deal with how to use deep learning frameworks, such as Tensorflow, PyTorch, Caffe2, and so on. It will cover only Python prerequisites for learning deep learning frameworks.

To start to learn any deep learning library, you should know the Python primitives: the reserved words, built-in functions, and data types in Python. At the same time, you should know how to write, run, and import a Python file, and how to use the interactive Python environment. 

After the basics, you should know widely used open source libraries and enviroments that are equipped with scientific computing. The libraries are, for example, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy, and Pandas. Numpy and Matplotlib are undisputablely essential tools for deep learning in terms of data representation and visualization. There are good software environments to help effectively, effieciently develop experiments using those libraires. For instance, there are Jupyter notebook or lab, Anaconda, Spyder, PyCharm, and so on. We will explore how to use those environments.

## Goals

### Python basics

#### Python primitives
* To understand built-in data types: `int`, `float`, `bool`, `NoneType`, `list`, `dict`, `tuple`, `set`   
  * `type()`
  * `len()`
  * To make an empty `Collections` instance
  * Add, delete, and modify elements in a `Collections` instance
* To assign a value to a variable
  * Call-by-value, call-by-reference
* To define a function
  * To understand the scope of variables
* To write `for` loops
   * Index access
   * Element-copy access
* To write `while` loops
* To use `break` and `continue` with loop statements
* To write commments

#### Python environments
* To execute a Python file
* To import functions from external files
  * To import a function from an external files
    * The scope of imported lines
  * To import all function from an external files
  
### Scientific computing tools for Python

#### Numpy
* Base N-dimensional array package
* Matrix operations

#### Matplotlib
* Comprehensive 2D Plotting

#### Scipy
* Fundamental library for scientific computing

#### Pandas
* Data structures & analysis

#### Etc.
* The Scipy ecosystem [[link](https://www.scipy.org/about.html#the-scipy-ecosystem)]
